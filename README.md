# Series-1-Fenarimols
This repository is for everything to do with the first series of molecules examined by the Open Source Mycetoma (MycetOS) drug discovery project. If you want to know more about what that means, head to the [general repository](https://github.com/OpenSourceMycetoma/General-Start-Here). You can also check [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MycetOS) for recent activity or to get in touch. 

The origin of this series is described in MycetOS's first paper, which can be read [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0006437)  --
The spreadsheet contaning the molecules MycetOS has examined to date [can be found here](http://tinyurl.com/MycetomaMols) (to visualise the spreadsheet, we'd recommend [Data Warrior](http://www.openmolecules.org/datawarrior/download.html)). 

Lab notebooks are located on [this page](https://github.com/OpenSourceMycetoma/Series-1-Fenarimols/wiki/Sources-of-Data).

# How to Help
Click the "Issues" tab above for current live requests for the community. You can use Issues to ask your own questions or make suggestions. You can also visit the [Reddit Community](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenSourceMycetoma/).

*However*, there are some recurring, major needs of the consortium:
1) Suggestions for molecules to make/obtain, based on the data generated to date.
2) People to make molecules, for example as part of lab classes
3) Contributions of molecules for biological evaluation - molecules in fridges/freezers that are either similar to those we're looking at, or potential possibly unrelated antifungals that have not yet been evaluated.
